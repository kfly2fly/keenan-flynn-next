    "It's been a long time since I've read a book that really made me think like this one. In this book, Cal Newport basically deconstructs the advice of \"Follow Your Passion\". In fact, he emphatically supports the idea of NOT following your passion. This is an extreme view on the age old adage. It would be pretty demoralizing if that was all this book is about, but luckily Newport offers us some advice. In particular, he addresses what really makes a standout career.",

    "Ok this novel was just badass. It was brutal, beautiful, and satisfying story telling. Steven Pressfield paints a vivid story of ancient Greece during the time of King Leonidas and the 300 Spartans. There's a lot of details about this story that the ancient historians left out, and Pressfield takes the artistic liberty of filling in these gaps.",

    "This is one that I've been putting off for a while. It's not my first Andy Weir book. We read Project Hail Mary in our book club : (link). That book was a far-fetched scientific thriller with a big infusion of the classic alien encounter. I ate it up. I love that stuff. I could just never bring myself to pick up The Martian. Perhaps because it's too close to reality (I saw the movie I read the book.. rookie mistake). Perhaps because I thought there wouldn't be any surprises (there are).",    summary: (
